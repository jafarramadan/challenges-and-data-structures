### Linked List implementaion


### Descreption :
This project contains a basic implementation of a singly linked list in C#. The linked list includes functionalities to add nodes, check for the presence of specific data, remove nodes, and print the list contents. This implementation also comes with unit tests using xUnit.

# part 2
### Descreption :


This project extends a basic implementation of a singly linked list in C#. The linked list now includes a new method, `RemoveDuplicate()`, which removes duplicate nodes from the list. The method iterates through the list, using two pointers (`current` and `runner`), to detect and eliminate duplicates efficiently. Unit tests using xUnit ensure the correctness of the `RemoveDuplicate()` method across different scenarios, such as lists with no duplicates, mixed duplicates, and lists consisting entirely of duplicates. The `Program.cs` file demonstrates the usage of the `RemoveDuplicate()` method by initializing a linked list with nodes containing both unique and duplicate values, then verifying the modified list contents after removing duplicates.
